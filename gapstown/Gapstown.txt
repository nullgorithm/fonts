Gapstown AH

The only excuse I have for making yet another hand printing
font is that I couldn't stand the sight of Comic Sans (TM) any
more.

Most of the free alternatives I know are too wacky, too artsy,
"individual" or specialized, however you put it, to print
bulk text. I was looking for something lively, not so accurate
as Comic Sans, that still looks good when printing many lines
of text, so it required some evenness of characters and spacing,
too.

Gapstown contains a full ISO 8859-1 character set, you can
write most western European languages with it. 193 manually
edited kerning pairs add to the quality of this font.
