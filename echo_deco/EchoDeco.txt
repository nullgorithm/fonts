"Chain Letter" is the 10th free font from Rich Gast. 

It was originally created on 06/14/98.

Version 2.0 was completed on 8/01/99. This version both updates the
copyright information from DarkSide Productions to GreyWolf WebWorks
and makes the font embeddable.

GreyWolf WebWorks Free Fonts (and versions previously released as
DarkSide's Free Fonts) are FREE for personal use. They do, however,
remain the copyrighted property of Rich Gast and GreyWolf WebWorks.
They are not in the public domain.

Commercial use in any manner, including (but not limited to) use in

NOTE TO PERSONAL USERS: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using
this font in some manner. If you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!
