A REQUEST FROM NATE547
======================
Once you install this font, find 2 ways to make the world, the country, your home state/province/county, or your hometown better than it is. Even if it's just recycling your newspaper instead of tossing it on the rubbish.
Of course you're not required by law to do this.... it's just a request from a Sensible Human who wants our world to change.

Duty now for the future.
